# Welcome to Framer!
*Take the guesswork out of your artwork!*

Ever made a wrong cut because your brain decided math was optional that day? Me too. That’s why I built **Framer** — a no-nonsense Python script that lets you *see* what your framed masterpiece will actually look like **before** you pick up the mat cutter and ruin a perfectly good Sunday.

But wait — there's more!

This isn’t just some boring static plot. Framer draws your frame **live** using Python’s good ol’ `turtle` module. That’s right — sit back and watch your framed art take shape, stroke by glorious stroke.

## ✂️ What It Does  
You give it:
- Your art’s width and height  
- Your desired mat overlaps and side widths  
- Frame and rabbet sizes  

And it gives you:
- A mesmerizing animated drawing of your final framed piece  
- All calculated dimensions (inner/outer mat and frame)  
- A built-in **1/16" framing tolerance** so your art fits like a glove, not a cram

---

## 🧠 Why?
Because:
- Mental math is a trap  
- Visualization prevents heartbreak  
- Watching `turtle` draw rectangles is deeply therapeutic

---

## 📦 Requirements  
- Python 3.x
